# Prediction of Authors based on Papers

The following project was meant to be part of Challegne assigment in a Machine Learning course designed by Dr. Grzegorz Chrupala, Dr. Çiçek Güven, Dr. Mojtaba Rostami Kandroodi.

- The main goal: to predict the lead author of a paper or authorID in a given dataset based on characteristics such as tittle, abstract, year, etc. 
- Dataset was provided by the designers of the course. 
- Evaluation metric: accuracy score 
- Methods: given the nature of the assigment, several methods where selected and tried with the purpose to enhance the accuracy score. 

### Files details: 

- train.json: dataset provided for the training and validation sets containing several features which are described in features.txt
- test.json: dataset with same features as train dataset but with no "authoID" which is the target value 
- features.txt: explanations of the features of the dataset provided 
- ML-Group.py: this was the last submission we did as a group with fellow collegues Fernando Iscar, Shan Cao, Robbie Werner. 
- Extended_version: file in which further work is done with the purpose again to enhance the accuracy and also to incorporate explanation to the code. (recomended for the reader to understand the mechanism)
